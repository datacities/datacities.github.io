## Vision
The cantonal administration knows its data assets. A working data governance across all domains governs the handling of data. This ensures security and efficiency and creates the foundation for publishing open government data.

## Principles

- **Interoperability** Different systems use the same concepts for the same content. Ensured with the help of semantic standards for metadata and concepts.
- **Once only** No redundant data processes. Enabling of secondary use of data. Benefit for citizens and businesses who only need to enter their data once.  Enabled via technical and legal foundations and adjustment of data processes.
- **Digital sustainability** Digital information should be produced and stored with scarce ressources in mind. They should be openly and permanently accessible.

## Goals
1. **Development of data-handling**
2. **Introduction of a metadata catalog**
3. **Make administrative data usable** as open government data (if legally permissable and technically feasible)

## Fields of action
The data strategy lists 6 fields of action (under the umbrella of Implementation).

1. **Foundations of Data Governance** Steering concepts (roles, responsabilities, data handling, processes, data model for metadata), data competencies and knowledge.
2. **Data assets** Description and cataloging of cantonal data assets.
3. **Open Government Data** Publication of relevant data if legally compliant.
4. **Legal foundations** As a basis for data governance and the publication of open government data.
5. **IT solutions** IT foundations for metadata catalog, publication of open government data and interoperability inside the administration.
6. **External interoperability** Coordination with initiatives outside the Canton regarding interoperability and open government data.

## Notes
The strategy uses a broad definition of the term *Data Governance` which includes data management, as well as data competencies.
