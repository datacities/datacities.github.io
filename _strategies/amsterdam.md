## Introduction and Context
Amsterdam’s Data Strategy sets out a framework for the city to regain control over its data and ensure that data collected within the city benefits the city’s residents. The strategy was developed in response to growing concerns about data privacy and the influence of major technology firms over the use of urban data.

## Vision and Objectives
**Vision:** "Data about the city should benefit the city and its residents."  
**Objectives:**  
- Increase transparency and control over urban data.  
- Ensure that residents have a say over how their data is used.  
- Improve decision-making using data while protecting privacy and rights.  
- Strengthen the city’s ability to manage data independently from private firms.  

## Data Culture and Competencies
- Training and education on data literacy for city employees and residents.  
- Establishment of guidelines on data governance and ethical data use.  
- Collaboration with universities and research institutes for data expertise.  

## Data Governance
- Implementation of the **Tada Values** framework, which emphasizes transparency, accountability, and citizen control over data.  
- Introduction of a city-wide algorithm register to disclose how data is processed.  
- Monitoring of data collection by private companies in public spaces.  

## Data Management
- Establishment of a centralized data infrastructure.  
- Creation of a data catalog with metadata to improve data accessibility.  
- Promotion of FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for municipal data.  

## Data Use
- Use of data to improve public transport, healthcare, and environmental management.  
- Predictive modeling and AI to improve city services and emergency response.  
- Monitoring data usage to prevent misuse and protect citizen privacy.  

## Organization

- Close coordination with national and EU regulators on data privacy and governance.  

## Value Creation
- Data used to drive innovation in public services and economic development.  
- Open data initiatives to stimulate new business models and research.  
- Improved decision-making through real-time data insights.  

## Additional Focus Areas

- Collaboration with EU initiatives such as **DECODE** and **Gaia-X** for ethical data sharing.  
- Regulation of data collection in public spaces to protect citizen privacy.  

## Implementation and Monitoring
- Regular updates to the strategy based on feedback from residents and stakeholders.  
- Performance monitored through KPIs on data use, privacy protection, and service improvements.

## Challenges and Risks
